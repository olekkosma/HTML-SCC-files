				Hi,<br>
					How you can see on a header, my name Is Aleksander Kosma. I am 19 years old student, who loves making graphic. I study IT on University, but 3D graphic I learn by myslef. I want to become famous  3D artist specialized in creatures and characters by sculpting and modelling. I had first contact with 3D when I was 16. It was software called Blender, with I am in love until now. Then I wanted to learn other software, the choise fell on Zbrush. In Zbrush I can open my artistic soul. After that I started to learn about some game art. I learned Substance Painter to do textures. Then I.... Every day I try to learn something new.<br><br>
					Why I want to be 3D artist? Because when I run Blender,Max,Maya,Zbrush or else I feel like a God...Nothing limists me, I can do what I want and as I want. It is one of the bests feels, belive me. Hmm, may it is one limit...amout of RAM : D. I try to use that opportunity every time I can. Sometimes is hard, but I am a great self-motivator. I take energy from small successes and do small steps to reach something big,without patient I woundn't do anything. Reasuming my motto is "be better than yesterday".<br><br>
					My proffesional experience is quite short, I am only 19. But I did some 3D models to print, and objects to some small internet cooperations. Now I am a freelanse so If you want to hire me, just write an email. But If someday there were opportunity to full part job, why not?<br><br>
					Here is software i mainly use:<br>
					-Blender<br>
					-Zbrush<br>
					-Substance Painter<br>
					-Substance Designer<br>
					-Photoshop<br>
					-Maya<br>
					-Max<br>
					-3D Coat<br>
					-Marmoset toolbag 2<br>
					<br><br>
					Here is an exaple of one of my motivators...posters of my works. When I get up, and go sleep I see that and think, "WOW i made this, awsome..."<br>
